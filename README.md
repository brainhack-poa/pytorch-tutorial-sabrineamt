## Pytorch Tutorial for Brainhack POA

This tutorial will guide you through the basics of PyTorch to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN). After that, we will train our CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset to be able to classify images from the CIFAR-10 testing set into the ten categories present in the dataset.

To do so, we will train our CNN model using Google Colaboratory TPU's. Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. With Colaboratory we can write and execute code, with no need of powerful computing resources, from our browser.
